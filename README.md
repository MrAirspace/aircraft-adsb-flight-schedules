So far, AMS/EHAM flights have been analysed and results:

Validation case study:
AMS/EHAM reference day 2024-06-14

Airline representation --> significantly close, within 5% error margin
Number of KLM flights 99.5% included in dataset on respective day

Destination/origin of a flight inaccurate 27% of time, to be updated.
